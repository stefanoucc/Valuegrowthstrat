Backtesting Investment Strategy
This project involves the implementation and evaluation of an investment strategy using historical financial data from bloomberg. The goal is to compare the performance of the strategy with that of benchmark investments. The code provided below demonstrates the process of backtesting the strategy and generating performance metrics using the quantstats library.

Importing Packages and Data
The initial step involves importing the necessary packages and the dataset containing the financial data. The dataset is read from an Excel file and stored in a pandas DataFrame. The index of the DataFrame is set to the 'Date' column, and data from a specific date onwards is selected for analysis.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to calculate the percent changes of various variables and the moving average of a specific variable. These calculations are performed using pandas' built-in functions and stored as new columns in the DataFrame.

Defining the Optimization Function
A function is defined to optimize the investment strategy based on a threshold value. The function calculates the returns of the strategy based on the threshold and returns the negative of the final investment value. The goal is to minimize this value during the optimization process.

Optimization
The optimization process is performed using scipy's minimize function. The function takes the optimization function, initial guess for the threshold, bounds for the threshold, and other parameters as inputs. The optimal threshold value is extracted from the result and used to update the returns column in the DataFrame.

Performance Calculation
The cumulative returns of the benchmark investments (SPY, SPYV, and SPYG) and the strategy are calculated using the percent changes. These values are stored in separate columns in the DataFrame.

Visualizations
Several visualizations are generated to illustrate the performance and distribution of returns. Line plots are created to show the cumulative returns of the benchmark investments and the strategy. Distribution plots are generated to display the frequency distribution of returns for each investment.

Results and Metrics
Performance metrics such as average return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio are calculated for the benchmark investments and the strategy. These metrics provide insights into the risk-adjusted performance of the investments. The results are displayed in a small DataFrame.

Backtesting
Backtesting of the investment strategy is performed using the quantstats library. The reports.html function is used to generate a comprehensive HTML report containing various performance metrics, including cumulative returns, annualized returns, drawdowns, and more. The report is saved to a specified location on the local system.

By following the code provided in this project, you can conduct backtesting of investment strategies and evaluate their performance using historical financial data. The generated metrics and visualizations can be used to assess the effectiveness of the strategy compared to benchmark investments.
